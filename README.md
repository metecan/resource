# reSource

reSource is a simple reverse-proxy built for re-sourcing image for your nextjs projects.

Made with [HonoJS](https://hono.dev).

## âœ¨ How it works?

turn into your image url as follows;

`resource.metecan.dev/?src=https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C`

then just put in your Image component.
